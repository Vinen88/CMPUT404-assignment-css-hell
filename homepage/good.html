            <h1>About:</h1>
            <p>
                I currently am working as a UX Engineer at GoDaddy, which is where my passion for design and development converge. See my previous work history on LinkedIn. Outside of work I have a beautiful wife and cat (obviously). I am also working on a few side projects including Investment Calculator (a simple tool to teach people about investing) and dayofthedead.holiday. Currently I am not accepting freelance work, but I'd love to get coffee and get to know you, so donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch.

        <h2>Services:</h2>
        <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
        <p>UI/UX involves planning and iterating a site's structure and layout. Once the proper information architecture is in place, I design the visual layer to create a beautiful user experience. </p>
        <h3>Front End Development</h3>
        <p>Front End Development is building out the visual components of a website. Using HTML, CSS , and Javascript, I build fast, interactive websites. This also may include a CMS, API's or other integrations. </p>
        <h3>Product Development</h3>
        <p>The work that I am most interested in is 0-1 work (helping you get your idea into the world). A recent example of this is Omelo a proof of concept that I built end to end (UI, back end business logic etc). </p>
